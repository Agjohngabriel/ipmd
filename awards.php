          <h2>IPMD Awards</h2>
          <p>“ICON OF LEADERSHIP AWARD, is a leadership excellence award platform created and promoted by the Governing  Council and Management of the  Institute to recognize, showcase and honour high octane personalities who have distinguished themselves in their chosen fields of human endeavour, impacted positively on humanity and added value to the national development process.</p>
          <p>Council and Management are of the incontrovertible and regrettable view that ours is a geo-political space where we squander, on the altar of negligence and parochialism, values, legacies, talents and iconoclastic imprints on our national sands of time, while celebrating mediocrity. This ugly scenario has robbed the fatherland of an invaluable fountain of inspiration and ruefully left us bereft of the navigational compass for meaningful development. Since “everything rises and falls on leadership” (Dr. J.C. Maxwell, the World’s Top Leadership Guru by leadershipgurus.net),the philosophical underpinning of the IPMD “ICON of Leadership Totem Pole” is:</p>
          <ul>
              <li class="py-2"><i class="ion-android-checkmark-circle"></i> To accord purposeful leadership a prime position in our national scheme of things;</li>
              <li class="py-2"><i class="ion-android-checkmark-circle"></i> To sift out leadership “firsts among equals” in different fields of human endeavour for hoisting on the highly coveted IPMD Totem Pole of Leadership Excellence as “ICON OF LEADERSHIP TOTEM POLE”;</li>
              <li class="py-2"><i class="ion-android-checkmark-circle"></i> To showcase and celebrate those rare leaders as role models and deep sources of inspiration to our generation and posterity;</li>
              <li class="py-2"><i class="ion-android-checkmark-circle"></i> To, in every detail, capture the totality of their life history, their experiences, life philosophy and leadership DNA, etc in a well researched IPMD-directed biographical project so as to preserve their worthy legacies as an inspirational bank for the contemporary and future generations as is done in civilized climes; and</li>
              <li class="py-2"><i class="ion-android-checkmark-circle"></i> To erect our national hall of fame on the super highway for universal access (via the World Wide Web, Facebook, etc) where those “icons” are featured as members of the badly needed National Leadership Critical Mass who would build up overtime to trigger the long-awaited solution to the intractable National Leadership Ineptitude.</li>
